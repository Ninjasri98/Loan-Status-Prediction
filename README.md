Loan Status Prediction Using SVM

This project uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on various applicant features. The model is trained on a dataset containing factors like income, credit score, and loan amount. The SVM algorithm effectively classifies the loan status with an accuracy of 79% on training data and 83% on test data
